# CS 480 Final Project

An electronic commerce website. This is an alternative version of the project, stored in this repository for completeness purposes. The original source code can be found at (Lakuna/CS-480-Final-Project)[https://github.com/Lakuna/CS-480-Final-Project].

Some differences exist between this version and the Python version. The most significant are:

- Vendors and Customers are merged into one User list. Vendors are listed as Users that are selling at least one Product.
- Users log in with just an email address. This is intended to be only a proof-of-concept. Further verification would be needed in a production environment.
- The source code is written in TypeScript using the Next.js framework.

- Travis Martin
